- **Verification Workflow**:
  - Automated checks: Basic validation of uploaded documents and links.
  - Manual review: Team verifies references, employment details, and overall profile authenticity.
  - Expected Outcomes: If approved, status updates to ACTIVE (verified). If additional information is needed, users are notified via email with specific requests.
