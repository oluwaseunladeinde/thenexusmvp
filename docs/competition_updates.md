# Updates from the Market

## LinkedIn
By [Ali Matar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matarali/) I’m excited to share that Hiring Assistant – LinkedIn’s first AI recruiting agent – will be available by the end of September.
 
Over the last year we’ve been piloting Hiring Assistant with more than 8,000 recruiters from 500+ companies, including companies in the UAE and KSA. Early results show that recruiters using Hiring Assistant save over 4 hours per role, uncovering qualified talent while reviewing 62% fewer profiles, and all while boosting candidate replies by 69%. 
 
These numbers translate directly into huge benefits for both recruiters and companies. One of the select Saudi companies in the pilot, MATARAT Holding | مطارات القابضة , said the new tool enhanced their efficiency and speed in sourcing qualified candidates, especially for critical and hard-to-fill positions, allowing the team to allocate more time to strategic hiring activities.

### LinkedIn Hiring Assistant rolls out globally TODAY.
 
I’m delighted to be part of a group of industry peers who have had the chance to preview how it works. And let me tell you - it’s got me thinking that I should
actually do this job again!

Here are a few things Hiring Assistant is going to do: 

1️⃣ Conducts multiple searches across LinkedIn simultaneously and continuously, on the back of whatever information (job description, intake note transcription, message or comment threads) YOU upload for your search. 

2️⃣ Learns how you interact with the candidates to refine results.. This is reinforcement learning through human feedback right here on the most important recruiter use case - reviewing candidate profiles. 

3️⃣ Crafts outreach messages personalised to each individual candidate you have selected for contact. Inmail acceptance rates are 69% higher for Hiring Assistant sourced vs traditionally sourced candidates

Now I don’t need AI to make the decisions for me, but I do need AI to supercharge my hiring efficiency.
