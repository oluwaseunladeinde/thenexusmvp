# Updates from the Market

## LinkedIn
By [Ali Matar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matarali/) I’m excited to share that Hiring Assistant – LinkedIn’s first AI recruiting agent – will be available by the end of September.
 
Over the last year we’ve been piloting Hiring Assistant with more than 8,000 recruiters from 500+ companies, including companies in the UAE and KSA. Early results show that recruiters using Hiring Assistant save over 4 hours per role, uncovering qualified talent while reviewing 62% fewer profiles, and all while boosting candidate replies by 69%. 
 
These numbers translate directly into huge benefits for both recruiters and companies. One of the select Saudi companies in the pilot, MATARAT Holding | مطارات القابضة , said the new tool enhanced their efficiency and speed in sourcing qualified candidates, especially for critical and hard-to-fill positions, allowing the team to allocate more time to strategic hiring activities.
