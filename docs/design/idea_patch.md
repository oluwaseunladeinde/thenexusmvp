# theNexus Motivation

We decided we need to build a solution that fits our cultural inclination. We adopt a well-thought-out strategy. Localisation was essential—companies that tailor their products and services to the cultural and economic realities of a market tend to perform better.

Targeting value segments is also an effective approach we adopted. Offering affordable product options helps us reach lower-income consumers.
