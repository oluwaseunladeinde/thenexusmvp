# TODO: HR Dashboard Gaps based on Epic 3.5

- [x] Implement Recent Activity Feed component:
   - Show introduction requests sent, requests accepted/declined
   - Show new saved professionals, profile views
   - Display human-readable timestamps
   - Add "View all" link to relevant pages

- [x] Update Quick Actions Section:
   - Add "View saved professionals" button linking to saved professionals page
   - Add "Buy credits" button visible conditionally (e.g., if trial or low credits)
   - Ensure buttons are styled consistently and accessible
   - Ensure responsive layout

- [x] Implement Pipeline View (Kanban):
   - Create Kanban board component with columns: Search → Contacted → Accepted → Interview → Offer
   - Show candidate name and role on cards
   - Support drag and drop between columns with backend update
   - Responsive and mobile friendly with horizontal scroll

These features need development to fully meet the HR Dashboard epic requirements.
